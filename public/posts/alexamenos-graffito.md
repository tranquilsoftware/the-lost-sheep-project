<!-- # The Alexamenos Graffito: Ancient Graffiti That Proves Jesus Was Crucified -->

## The Oldest Known Depiction of the Crucifixion

Graffiti dating back nearly 2,000 years offers a fascinating glimpse into early perceptions of Jesus. Found near Palatine Hill in Rome, the crude drawing depicts a man with a donkey's head nailed to a cross, accompanied by the words:

**"Alexamenos worships his God"**

This piece of ancient graffiti, known as the **Alexamenos Graffito**, is not just a curiosity—it's one of the most important archaeological discoveries for Christian apologetics.

## What the Graffiti Shows

The Alexamenos Graffito, discovered in 1857 in the **domus Gelotiana building** on the Palatine Hill in Rome, is a piece of ancient graffiti scratched into plaster. The graffito has since been removed from its original location and is now housed in the **Palatine Museum**. The drawing shows:

- A figure with arms outstretched on a cross
- The figure has the head of a donkey
- To the left stands another figure (Alexamenos) with one arm raised in worship
- Greek inscription: **"ΑΛΕΞΑΜΕΝΟΣ ϹΕΒΕΤΕ ΘΕΩΝ"** (Alexamenos worships [his] God)

### Historical Context of the Location

The building where the graffito was found has a fascinating history. Emperor **Caligula** acquired the house for the imperial palace, and after his death, it became a **Paedagogium**—a boarding school for imperial page boys. This context is crucial because it suggests the graffiti may have been created by young Roman students mocking a fellow student (Alexamenos) for his Christian faith.

### Dating and Scholarly Debate

The exact dating of the graffito is difficult to determine. While it has been **estimated to have been made around the year 200 AD**, scholarly opinions vary with **dates ranging from the late 1st century AD to the late 3rd century AD**. This uncertainty reflects the challenges of precisely dating ancient graffiti, but it consistently places the artifact within the crucial early Christian period.

## Why This Is Powerful Evidence

### 1. It Confirms the Crucifixion Narrative

Critics sometimes claim that the crucifixion of Jesus was invented by later Christians. However, the Alexamenos Graffito dates to approximately **200 AD**, making it the oldest known pictorial representation of the crucifixion.

The fact that pagans were mocking Christians for worshipping a crucified figure proves that:
- **Jesus was indeed crucified** (not some other form of execution)
- **Early Christians worshipped Jesus as God**
- **The crucifixion was central to Christian identity** from the very beginning

### 2. It Shows Early Christian Persecution

The graffiti is clearly mocking—it depicts Jesus with a donkey's head, a common pagan insult suggesting Christians worshipped an ass. This reveals much about Roman cultural attitudes and why Christianity was so offensive to their sensibilities.

#### Why a Donkey Head? The Ultimate Insult

In Roman culture, the donkey (ass) was considered:
- **A symbol of stupidity and foolishness** - donkeys were seen as stubborn, unintelligent beasts of burden
- **A representation of low status** - only the poorest people used donkeys for transportation
- **Associated with foreign cults** - Romans viewed donkey-worship as barbaric and primitive
- **A sign of degradation** - to be compared to a donkey was one of the worst insults in Roman society

The donkey head wasn't random—it was carefully chosen to mock what Romans saw as the absurdity of Christian worship. As the Roman historian Tacitus later wrote, Christians were hated for their "hatred against mankind" and "degraded superstitions."

#### The Roman Mindset: Why Worship a Crucified Man?

To understand the full impact of this graffiti, we must grasp Roman cultural values:

**Roman Attitudes Toward Crucifixion:**
- **Crucifixion was the most shameful death possible** - reserved for slaves, rebels, and the lowest criminals
- **No respectable Roman citizen would ever mention crucifixion** in polite company
- **The cross represented utter defeat and disgrace** - to be crucified meant you were the scum of society
- **Romans valued power, honor, and victory** - a crucified man represented the opposite of everything they admired

**The Absurdity of Christian Worship:**
From a Roman perspective, Christians were doing the unthinkable:
- **Worshipping a criminal** executed in the most disgraceful manner
- **Following a failed messiah** who couldn't even save himself from death
- **Proclaiming as Lord** someone Rome had publicly defeated and humiliated
- **Choosing shame over honor** by embracing the cross as a symbol of faith

As the Apostle Paul acknowledged, this message was "a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles" (1 Corinthians 1:23). To Romans, the idea of worshipping a crucified man was like modern people worshipping a convicted serial killer—it was incomprehensible and repulsive.

#### Why This Matters for Apologetics

The very fact that Romans felt compelled to mock Christians this way proves:
- **Christians were publicly proclaiming** the crucifixion from the earliest days
- **The resurrection message was so powerful** that people were willing to endure public shame for it
- **The cross was central to Christian identity** - not a later invention
- **Early Christians remained faithful** despite intense cultural pressure to conform

The donkey-headed Jesus on the cross wasn't just artistic mockery—it was the Roman Empire's attempt to make sense of why anyone would follow a crucified criminal. Their inability to understand Christian devotion inadvertently became powerful evidence for the truth of the resurrection.

### 3. It Demonstrates Historical Continuity

The graffito bridges the gap between the biblical accounts and later historical records. It shows that:
- **The crucifixion story was well-known** in pagan Rome
- **Christian worship practices** were recognizable to outsiders
- **The core Christian message** remained unchanged from the apostolic age

## The Historical Context

### Roman Attitudes Toward Crucifixion

In Roman society, crucifixion was:
- **The most shameful form of execution**
- **Reserved for slaves, rebels, and the lowest criminals**
- **Considered so disgraceful** that respectable Roman citizens would never mention it in polite company

The fact that Christians proudly proclaimed a crucified Savior was scandalous to Roman sensibilities. As the Apostle Paul wrote:

> "For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God." **1 Corinthians 1:18, ESV**

### Pagan Misunderstandings

The donkey head in the graffiti likely stems from pagan misunderstandings of Jewish and Christian traditions. Some Romans believed that Jews (and by extension, Christians) worshipped a donkey-headed god in their temple—a rumor that may have originated from the Jewish prohibition against eating horseflesh and donkey flesh.

## Archaeological Significance

*The actual Alexamenos Graffito as it appears today*

The graffito is significant because it:
- **Dates to the early 3rd century AD** (c. 200 AD)
- **Was found in a location** where a Christian school likely existed
- **Provides contemporary evidence** of Christian practices and beliefs
- **Confirms biblical accounts** of early Christian persecution

## What This Means for Christian Apologetics

### Evidence for the Resurrection

The Alexamenos Graffito indirectly supports the resurrection account. Why would early Christians:
- **Endure persecution** for a crucified criminal?
- **Worship someone** executed in the most shameful way possible?
- **Risk their lives** proclaiming Jesus as Lord?

The only logical explanation is that they **believed Jesus had risen from the dead** and was indeed God.

### Confirmation of Biblical Reliability

This archaeological artifact confirms that:
- **The New Testament accounts** are historically accurate
- **Early Christian beliefs** match biblical descriptions
- **The crucifixion was not** a later invention

## The Courage of Alexamenos

We don't know much about Alexamenos, but his courage speaks volumes:
- **He was willing to be identified** as a Christian
- **He faced public ridicule** for his faith
- **His faith remained strong** despite persecution

Like Alexamenos, early Christians were willing to endure shame and persecution because they knew the truth of the resurrection. As Paul wrote:

> "But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world." **Galatians 6:14, ESV**

## Conclusion: Powerful Archaeological Evidence

The Alexamenos Graffito is more than just ancient graffiti—it's **powerful archaeological evidence** that confirms:

1. **Jesus was crucified** exactly as the Bible describes
2. **Early Christians worshipped Jesus as God**
3. **Christians faced persecution** for their beliefs
4. **The resurrection message** was proclaimed despite opposition

This 2,000-year-old piece of graffiti, meant to mock Christian faith, has become one of the strongest pieces of archaeological evidence supporting the truth of Christianity. It reminds us that even the attempts of skeptics to discredit the faith can ultimately serve to confirm its historical reality.

The next time someone questions whether Jesus was really crucified, you can point to the Alexamenos Graffito—ancient evidence that even the enemies of Christianity couldn't help but testify to the central truth of the Gospel: **Jesus Christ was crucified for our sins, and He is indeed Lord of all.**
